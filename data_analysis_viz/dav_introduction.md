### Teaching methods

* I do, we do, you do
    * I will demo an idea using live coding
	* We will work on an associated exercise together in class
	* You will use what you learn in your research projects
	
* Peer instruction
    * Interact with each other during the we do and you do parts
	* You are at least as likely to learn from your peers as from me
