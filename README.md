FHL 470 - Historical Marine Ecology Research Experience  
Friday Harbor Labs, University of Washington  
Co-instructors: Robin Elahi, Hilary Hayford  
Spring 2018  

Research in Marine Biology will enable students to engage in a practical research experience in close collaboration with supervisors.  The research topic is the historical ecology of rocky shores, focusing on human impacts on invertebrates, algae, and plants covered in the associated zoology and botany courses.  Major emphases of the course will be the creative use of observational methods and comparative natural history in the field.  Through library and field research, students will learn about scientific thinking, reproducible science, and the process of becoming a professional scientist.
