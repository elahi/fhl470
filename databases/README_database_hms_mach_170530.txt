Synopsis

Database of studies conducting quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative data collection in the Monterey Bay region. Database includes information on why, where adn how the study was conducted, as well as its strength (criteria determining whether it would a good study to repeat today).


Motivation

Few places in the ocean benefit from long-term multidecadal-to-centennial studies of biodiversity and of the processes that may regulate diversity patterns. Monterey Bay is one such place with a rich legacy of quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative work exceeding 150 years. We seek — for the first time — to assemble this legacy in three ways: 1) A database that captures results over three eras (1860s-1920s; 1930s-1980s; 1990s-2016) while focusing on quantitative research of communities that has been repeated once or multiple times, or would be highly amenable to repetition, 2) oral histories of those familiar with Monterey Bay biodiversity over the past 50 years (download database at: http://purl.stanford.edu/XXXX), and 3) establishing long-term sampling of the intertidal zone around Hopkins Marine Station (analyzing and continuing to sample the Hewatt-Sagarin intertidal transect).

Despite the superb foundations laid by multiple institutions, remarkably few studies have been repeated that serve to detect biodiversity changes that could be linked to intensive changes in water quality, land-use, fisheries, climate, and trophic cascades. Rare examples include a classic 1931-33 intertidal study at Hopkins Marine Station by Hewatt, repeated in 1949 by Provin and 1993-96 and 2000-14 by Rafe Sagarin (sampling continues today), a sandy bottom community studied in 1971-75 and 1997-98, and limited reprisals of other studies, along with one study on the altered distribution of a turf algae from the 1890s to the 2000s. As exemplified by the Hewatt-Sagarin transect, we predict that many foundational studies, when repeated, will also produce profound insights into the scale of changes from the 19th to the 21st centuries.


Files

These files are available for download from the Stanford Digital Repository. The report includes the results of the study as well as a summary of researchers, students and visitors interivewed to discuss their memories of these habitats in the 1940s-1980s. Two databases are included for download. The main database includes all reports, journals, conference proceedings etc. except student studies, the second database includes only student studies. The reasoning for this can be found in the report.
